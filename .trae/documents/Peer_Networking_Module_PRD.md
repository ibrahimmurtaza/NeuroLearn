## 3. Core Process

**Peer Discovery Flow:**
Students access the Peer Discovery page where AI algorithms suggest compatible peers based on their profile data, interests, and study goals. Users can browse suggestions, apply filters, and view detailed compatibility scores. They can send connection requests with personalized messages or save profiles for later review.

**Connection Management Flow:**
Users receive connection requests in their Connection Hub, where they can review requester profiles, mutual connections, and compatibility information. Upon accepting connections, users can categorize relationships (study partner, project collaborator) and begin collaborative activities. The system tracks interaction frequency and suggests strengthening weak connections.

**Study Group Participation Flow:**
Students can create or join study groups based on subjects, courses, or projects. Group leaders manage membership, schedule sessions, and facilitate discussions. Members collaborate through shared tools, participate in group activities, and track collective progress toward study goals.

**Notification and Engagement Flow:**
The system sends real-time notifications for connection activities, group updates, and study opportunities. Users can customize notification preferences and engage with alerts directly from the notification center. Analytics help users understand their networking effectiveness and suggest improvements.

### 5.3 Matching Algorithm

The peer suggestion algorithm considers multiple factors:

1. **Interest Overlap** (40% weight): Array intersection of user interests
2. **Academic Field Match** (25% weight): Exact or related field matching
3. **Study Goals Alignment** (20% weight): Similar learning objectives
4. **Activity Level** (10% weight): Platform engagement compatibility
5. **Mutual Connections** (5% weight): Shared network connections

**Compatibility Score Calculation:**

```javascript
function calculateCompatibility(user1, user2) {
    const interestScore = calculateInterestOverlap(user1.interests, user2.interests) * 0.4;
    const fieldScore = calculateFieldMatch(user1.academic_field, user2.academic_field) * 0.25;
    const goalScore = calculateGoalAlignment(user1.study_goals, user2.study_goals) * 0.2;
    const activityScore = calculateActivityCompatibility(user1.activity_level, user2.activity_level) * 0.1;
    const mutualScore = calculateMutualConnections(user1.id, user2.id) * 0.05;
    
    return Math.round((interestScore + fieldScore + goalScore + activityScore + mutualScore) * 100);
}
```

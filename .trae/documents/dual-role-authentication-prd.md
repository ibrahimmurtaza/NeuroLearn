# NeuroLearn Dual-Role Authentication System - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

NeuroLearn will be enhanced to support two distinct user roles: Students and Tutors, enabling a comprehensive educational platform that serves both learners and educators. This enhancement transforms NeuroLearn from a student-only platform into a dual-sided marketplace connecting students with qualified tutors.

The system will maintain backward compatibility with existing student-focused features while introducing tutor-specific functionality and role-based access control. This creates value for both user segments: students gain access to personalized tutoring, while tutors can monetize their expertise through the platform.

## 3. Core Process

**Student Goal Management Flow:**
Students create goals with deadlines and availability constraints. The AI system automatically generates subtasks and schedules them across available time slots. Students interact with checklist-style task management, marking items complete as they progress. The system tracks completion patterns and suggests optimal scheduling for future tasks based on productivity analytics.

**Dynamic Rescheduling Flow:**
When tasks are missed or uncompleted, the system automatically identifies conflicts and suggests rescheduling options. Users can accept suggestions or manually adjust schedules. The system learns from these interactions to improve future scheduling recommendations.

**Calendar Integration Flow:**
Users connect external calendars through OAuth authentication. The system syncs tasks as calendar events and monitors for conflicts. When conflicts arise, the system suggests alternative scheduling and maintains synchronization across all connected platforms.

**Productivity Optimization Flow:**
The system continuously tracks when users complete tasks, analyzing patterns by time of day, task type, and difficulty. It generates suggestions for optimal task placement and provides insights into productivity trends through visual analytics.

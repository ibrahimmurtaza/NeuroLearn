## 3. Core Process

**Main User Flow:**
Users begin by uploading content through the Summarization Dashboard, where files are processed and stored in the Document Library. They then navigate to the Summary Workspace to generate summaries with customizable length and query options. Advanced users can perform Multi-Document Analysis for comprehensive insights. Finally, users can create Notes & Flashcards or export their work through the Export Center.

**Content Processing Flow:**
Content ingestion → Preprocessing (OCR, transcription) → Text extraction → Summarization engine → Post-processing (translation, categorization) → Output generation

**Query-Based Flow:**
User query → Document selection → Relevant chunk retrieval → Context-aware summarization → Result presentation with source citations
